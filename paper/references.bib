abstract = {Climate change, severe droughts, population growth, demand increase, and poor management during the recent decades have further stressed the scarce freshwater resources worldwide and resulted in severe water shortages in many regions. The water utilities address the water shortage by providing alternative source of water, augment the supplied water, supply intermittently, and even bulk water delivery under severe water shortage conditions. On the other hand, many households store water in building storage tanks to cope with insufficient delivery of potable water due to frequent interruptions. All these practices could pose crucial risks to the chemical and microbiological quality of the water. However, consistent monitoring and implementation of mitigation strategies could lower the potential risks associated with these practices. It is critical to identify the potential hazards resulting from the alternative water supplies and distribution practices to develop temporary and long-term monitoring and mitigation plans and reduce the microbial and chemical contamination of potable water delivered to the consumers. This paper provides a holistic review of the significant hazards associated with the practices employed by the water utilities and water consumers to alleviate the potable water shortage and discusses the required monitoring and mitigation practices.}

abstract = {Agriculture contributes to a major share in the Indian economy and most of its people are dependent on it for their livelihood. This makes water an important resource that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies. Apart from being fundamental in industry 4.0, IoT also extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed here targets to develop a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It uses IoT to make devices used in the system to talk and connect on their own, with capabilities like: admin mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation, neural based decision making for intelligent support and remote data monitoring. A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results of the proposed system, that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision making and remote data viewing. Neural network provides required intelligence to the device that considers current sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule for efficient irrigation. The system uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed about the current crop situation even from a distant location. The proposed system proves beneficial with its intelligence, low cost and portability, making it suitable for greenhouse, farms, etc.}
