abstract = {Climate change, severe droughts, population growth, demand increase, and poor management during the recent decades have further stressed the scarce freshwater resources worldwide and resulted in severe water shortages in many regions. The water utilities address the water shortage by providing alternative source of water, augment the supplied water, supply intermittently, and even bulk water delivery under severe water shortage conditions. On the other hand, many households store water in building storage tanks to cope with insufficient delivery of potable water due to frequent interruptions. All these practices could pose crucial risks to the chemical and microbiological quality of the water. However, consistent monitoring and implementation of mitigation strategies could lower the potential risks associated with these practices. It is critical to identify the potential hazards resulting from the alternative water supplies and distribution practices to develop temporary and long-term monitoring and mitigation plans and reduce the microbial and chemical contamination of potable water delivered to the consumers. This paper provides a holistic review of the significant hazards associated with the practices employed by the water utilities and water consumers to alleviate the potable water shortage and discusses the required monitoring and mitigation practices.}

abstract = {Agriculture contributes to a major share in the Indian economy and most of its people are dependent on it for their livelihood. This makes water an important resource that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies. Apart from being fundamental in industry 4.0, IoT also extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed here targets to develop a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It uses IoT to make devices used in the system to talk and connect on their own, with capabilities like: admin mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation, neural based decision making for intelligent support and remote data monitoring. A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results of the proposed system, that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision making and remote data viewing. Neural network provides required intelligence to the device that considers current sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule for efficient irrigation. The system uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed about the current crop situation even from a distant location. The proposed system proves beneficial with its intelligence, low cost and portability, making it suitable for greenhouse, farms, etc.}

abstract = {The scarcity of clean water resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’ data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape. This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging.}

ABSTRACT = {Water is of vital and critical importance to ecosystems and human societies. The effects of human activities on land and water are now large and extensive. These reflect physical changes to the environment. Global change such as urbanization, population growth, socioeconomic change, evolving energy needs, and climate change have put unprecedented pressure on water resources systems. It is argued that achieving water security throughout the world is the key to sustainable development. Studies on holistic view with persistently changing dimensions is in its infancy. This study focuses on narrative review work for giving a comprehensive insight on the concept of water security, its evolution with recent environmental changes (e.g., urbanization, socioeconomic, etc.) and various implications. Finally, it presents different sustainable solutions to achieve water security. Broadly, water security evolves from ensuring reliable access of enough safe water for every person (at an affordable price where market mechanisms are involved) to lead a healthy and productive life, including that of future generations. The constraints on water availability and water quality threaten secured access to water resources for different uses. Despite recent progress in developing new strategies, practices and technologies for water resource management, their dissemination and implementation has been limited. A comprehensive sustainable approach to address water security challenges requires connecting social, economic, and environmental systems at multiple scales. This paper captures the persistently changing dimensions and new paradigms of water security providing a holistic view including a wide range of sustainable solutions to address the water challenges.},
